## Build instructions on Raspberry Pi
```
cd <project-dir>
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make -j 1
```
  
## Build with QtCreator
- Just open the .pro file in QtCreator.
- Most of the configuration should be done automatically by QtCreator, e.g. you get your three profiles "Debug", "Release" and "Profile" you can choose from.
